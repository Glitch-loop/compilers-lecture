## What was the homework about?
In this homework we had to extend the functionality of a chatbot provided by the teacher.

## What features were added to the chatbot?
1. Generate a positive random number.
2. Generate a negative random number.
3. Generate a positive random numner in a range.
4. Generate a negative random numner in a range.

The first two features were added only to have pratical experiance creating a rule with two possibilities.

The last two were added to comprehend the flow of the information between a lex file and a yacc file (in a compiler it would be the flow between an lexical and grammatical analyzer).

# How to use the grammar rules?
They have similar sintaxis since they have as origin the first grammar rules that was "generate a positive random number". the grammar for each rule is:

1. give me a random number
2. give me a negative random number
3. give me a random number between 1 10
4. give me a negative random number between 30 50
